- Use logging instead of fmt.Print*

- Improve structure of project by grouping things more logically

- Deal with output bigger than 80 characters. For example display first 20 and
  last 40 characters and ... in between

- Accept multiple command line parameters

- Accept a single file as command line parameter

- Deal with file system errors such as permission denied etc.

- Display several critical paths if several directories with similar sizes exist

- Make tool interactive to allow querying for interesting data after building the tree

- Add option to exclude paths

- Optional: Generate HTML report

- Test performance with big and deep directory trees. Sorting of files possibly needs optimization.

- Can performance be improved by using goroutines? Every routine could build/analyze a part of the tree
