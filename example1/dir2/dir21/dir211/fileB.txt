Go (often referred to as golang) is a free and open source[12] programming
language created at Google[13] in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken
Thompson.[10] It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of
Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing,[3] memory
safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.[14]
